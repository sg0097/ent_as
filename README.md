# ENTNT-Dental-Center-Assignment

Dental Clinic Dashboard - React Application

A feature-rich Dental Clinic Management Dashboard built with React, designed to manage patients, appointments, and treatments efficiently. This application uses mock data only (no backend or database), making it ideal for demos, assignments, and frontend-focused development.

📁 Architecture Overview

/src

├── components/         # Reusable UI components (Forms, Cards, Modals)

├── context/            # DataProvider - global state using React Context

├── pages/              # Page views: Dashboard, Patients, Reports

├── types/              # Type declarations for patients/incidents

├── App.jsx             # Root component with route configs

├── main.jsx            # Entry point of app

└── index.css           # Tailwind and global styles

⚙️ Core Features

Add, update, and delete patients
Record and edit treatment incidents
Track appointment statuses: Scheduled, In-Progress, Completed
Dashboard metrics: total patients, total appointments, monthly & weekly revenue
Form validation and error handling
Responsive UI using modals and Tailwind
Modern icons with Lucide-React

🤞 Mock Data Used

Stored in-memory (no persistence):

INITIAL_PATIENTS: Sample patient records
INITIAL_INCIDENTS: Appointment and treatment logs
Dashboard metrics computed from mock data
No backend or database is used. Ideal for local development or frontend demos.

🛠️ Technical Decisions

Area	Choice & Reason
State	Context API - lightweight and scoped
Build	Vite - fast dev server & HMR support
Styling	Tailwind CSS - utility-first & responsive design
Redux	Not used - unnecessary for app scale
DB/API	Skipped - app uses static mock data only

⚠️ Known Issues / Limitations

Data is lost on page refresh (in-memory only)
No authentication or authorization implemented
Mobile responsiveness can be improved
File uploads are mocked (no real upload functionality)

🎯 Future Improvements

Add Firebase or Auth0 for user authentication
Use Supabase or Firebase for data persistence
Add filtering, sorting, and searching capabilities
Export patient or incident reports to PDF/CSV
Improve mobile responsiveness and accessibility
